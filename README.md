## Introduction

## Setup

### Install & Update Dependencies
The first time you start the server you may want to make sure you have the dependencies installed, in the right versions. To do so, just go to the terminal and type:

```
$ npm install
```
### Install StandardJS Linter
[StandardJS](https://standardjs.com/) is a JavaScript style guide, linter, and formatter.

#### VSCode Extension
You may want to install [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chenxsan.vscode-standardjs)

> VSCODE `SETTINGS.JSON`:
```
  "javascript.validate.enable": false,
  "standard.enable": true,
  "standard.run": "onType",
  "standard.autoFixOnSave": false,
  "standard.usePackageJson": true
```

*Make sure you don't have duplicate rules!*

### Environment Variables

The next setup step is to create an `Environment Variable` file `.env` in this folder. We have provided a `.env.example` for you with a sample configuration for both **development** and **production** environments.

Make your own copy_
```
$ cp .env.example .env
```

And customize the sample params to your needs

- mongoURL: "mongodb://localhost/",
- mongoDBName: 'example',
- apiKeys : "fakeapikey",
- port : 5000

## Start local Server

You can start your server anytime with:

```
$ npm run dev
```

You should see something like:
```
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://192.168.43.142:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```
